# 🗑️ TrashCan - Safer Deletes for Linux

**TrashCan** is a simple, lightweight command-line utility that protects you from accidental file deletions by moving files to a custom trash folder (`~/.trashcan`) instead of permanently deleting them.

Easily move files to trash, list deleted files, restore them, or permanently purge old trash.
