# 🗑️ TrashCan - Step-by-Step Guide

TrashCan is a safer way to delete files on Linux.  
Instead of permanently deleting your files, TrashCan moves them to a safe folder where you can restore or permanently purge them later.

Follow these simple steps to use TrashCan:

## ✅ Step 1: Make sure you have Python 3
Open your terminal and check the Python version:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If you see `Python 3.x.x`, you're ready!

## 📥 Step 2: Download the TrashCan script
Make sure you have the `trashcan.py` file in your working directory.

(Optional) Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x trashcan.py
```

## 📄 Step 3: Create a test file
Let’s create a file to test TrashCan:
```bash
echo "Hello TrashCan!" > testfile.txt
```

## 🗑️ Step 4: Move a file to TrashCan (safe delete)
Run this command to move the file to TrashCan:
```bash
python3 trashcan.py delete testfile.txt
```
You should see something like:
```
Moved 'testfile.txt' to trash as 'testfile.txt_1744145534'.
```

## 📋 Step 5: List trashed files
See what’s inside your TrashCan:
```bash
python3 trashcan.py list
```
You'll see something like:
```
testfile.txt_1744145534 -> /home/user/testfile.txt (deleted 2025-04-08T10:45:21)
```
🔑 **Note:** Copy the full filename with the underscore and timestamp — you’ll need this for the restore step.

## ♻️ Step 6: Restore your file
To bring the file back from TrashCan, run:
```bash
python3 trashcan.py restore 1
```
You should see:
```
Restored '/home/user/testfile.txt'
```
Check the file is back:
```bash
cat testfile.txt
```

## ✅ You’re done!
TrashCan is now working and keeping your files safe from accidental deletion.

## 🧹 Optional next steps
- Use `python3 trashcan.py purge 0` to permanently delete all files in the trash.
- Use `python3 trashcan.py help` to see all available commands.
