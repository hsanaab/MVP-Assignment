TrashCan - Enhanced Recycle Bin for Linux

Description:
TrashCan safely deletes your files by moving them to a custom trash folder (~/.trashcan). Files can be restored by ID or permanently purged.

Usage:
  python3 trashcan.py delete <file>     # Move a file to trash
  python3 trashcan.py list              # List all trashed files
  python3 trashcan.py restore <id>      # Restore a file by ID
  python3 trashcan.py purge             # Empty the trash
  python3 trashcan.py help              # Show help

Examples:
  python3 trashcan.py delete notes.txt
  python3 trashcan.py list
  python3 trashcan.py restore 1
  python3 trashcan.py purge

Quick Tip:
Files older than 7 days are automatically purged. Check 'list' often!

Troubleshooting:
- Make sure file paths are correct.
- TrashCan auto-creates a database and folder in your home directory.
